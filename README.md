# Spy City 🌃

> **"If the stock market were a city, what would it look like at night?"**

Spy City renders every S&P 500 company as a building in a procedurally generated 3D night-time metropolis. Building height and footprint are derived from market capitalization — Apple and Microsoft tower as skyscrapers, smaller companies form the low-rise districts. Navigate the financial skyline, search for companies, and explore live market data in an immersive 3D environment.

**Live Demo:** [https://spy-city.vercel.app/](https://spy-city.vercel.app/)

**Portfolio Project** • **Open Source** • **Financial Education**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Next.js 14 App Router | Server-side API proxy, SSR, Vercel deployment |
| **3D Engine** | React Three Fiber + drei | Declarative Three.js, OrbitControls, Stars, Html |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type-safe financial math and company data |
| **UI** | Tailwind CSS v4 | HUD, search, info panel styling |
| **State** | Zustand | Bridge between R3F scene and DOM UI |
| **Data** | Finnhub API (live) + Static JSON (fallback) | Market data, quotes, metrics |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | Zero-config, env vars, free tier |

**The golden rule:** React/Next.js owns the DOM. R3F owns the canvas. They communicate **only** through Zustand — never directly.

**Inspired by:** [git-city](https://github.com/srizzon/git-city) — Same stack (Next.js + R3F), city-grid layout, fly-to navigation, night aesthetic

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spy-city
cd spy-city

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables (optional — fallback data works without API keys)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your Finnhub API key (free tier: https://finnhub.io)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment Variables

**Required for live data:**
```bash
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_key_here   # Get free key at https://finnhub.io
```

**How it works:**
- Without API key → City renders with static constituent data (ticker, name, sector)
- With API key → Live prices, market cap, daily changes, company metrics

**API key is server-side only** — all Finnhub calls are proxied through `/api/quotes/route.ts`. Your key is never exposed to the browser.

---

## 🎮 Navigation & Controls

### Mouse
- **Left-click + drag** — Orbit camera around city
- **Scroll** — Zoom in/out (zoom-to-cursor enabled)
- **Click building** — Select, fly-to, show info panel
- **Click ground** — Deselect, return to aerial view

### Keyboard
- **ESC** — Reset to default aerial view, deselect building
- **WASD** — Free-flight mode (disabled during building selection)
- **Q/E** — Ascend/descend in free-flight

### UI
- **Search bar** — Type ticker or company name, select result to fly to building
- **Sector legend** — Shows color-coded sector list (filter mode planned)
- **Info panel** — Company details when building selected
- **Minimap** — Top-down 2D overview with selected building indicator

**Architecture principle:** R3F scene (`src/city/`) and DOM UI (`src/components/`) communicate **only** through the Zustand store. No direct imports between the two.

## 📊 Data Pipeline

### S&P 500 Constituent List
**Source:** [Datahub.io S&P 500 Dataset](https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies)  
**Format:** CSV → JSON (converted via `scripts/csv-to-json.js`)  
**Fields:** Ticker, Company Name, GICS Sector  
**Refresh:** Quarterly (S&P 500 rebalances ~4× per year)

```bash
# To update constituents after S&P rebalancing:
node scripts/csv-to-json.js
# Converts src/util/constituents.csv → src/data/constituents.json
```

### Live Market Data
**Source:** [Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io) (free tier: 60 calls/min)  
**Endpoints:**
- `/quote` — Price, market cap, daily % change
- `/stock/metric` — Beta, 52-week high/low, shares outstanding
- `/stock/profile2` — Company name, exchange, industry

**Rate limit strategy:**  
503 companies ÷ 60 calls/min = ~9 minutes if sequential. Solution: **Batch in chunks of 55 tickers with 1,100ms between chunks**. Buildings update progressively as each chunk resolves.

**Caching (two layers):**
1. **Server cache** (`unstable_cache`) — 24h TTL, shared across all visitors
2. **Client cache** (`localStorage`) — 24h TTL, serves stale data instantly on repeat visits

**Fallback chain:** Server cache → localStorage → static `constituents.json` — City never renders blank.

## 🎨 Visual Theme — Night Owl

Spy City uses a **Night Owl** dark theme — every visual decision reinforces the feeling of a city seen from above at 2am.

### Color Palette
| Element | Color | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| Sky / Background | Deep navy | `#000814` |
| Ground / Asphalt | Near-black | `#030810` |
| Streets (2-way) | Dark asphalt | `#0a0f1a` |
| Boulevards (4-lane) | Lighter asphalt | `#0d1420` |
| Sidewalks | Muted gray | `#1a2030` |
| Window lights | Warm amber / Blue-white | `#ffe080` / `#a8d8ff` |
| Street lamps | Sodium yellow | `#ffffaa` |
| Moon | Cool white | `#ddeeff` |
| Fog | Exponential fog | `#000814` density 0.0022 |

### Sector Colors
```ts
Technology:  #00d4ff  // Cyan
Finance:     #ffd700  // Gold
Healthcare:  #ff4757  // Red
Consumer:    #ff6348  // Orange
Industrial:  #a29bfe  // Purple
Energy:      #00b894  // Green
Materials:   #fdcb6e  // Yellow
Real Estate: #6c5ce7  // Violet
Utilities:   #74b9ff  // Light blue
```

### Lighting
- **Directional moonlight** — Upper-right, `#4466aa`, intensity 0.4
- **Ambient light** — `#102040`, intensity 1.0
- **City-centre pulse** — Slow sin-wave point light, `#0033aa`
- **Street lamps** — Point lights at every intersection, `#ffffaa`, radius 24 units
- **Selection beam** — Vertical cone + ground ring, sector color, additive blending

## 🏗️ City Layout — Block-Based Grid

Inspired by git-city's city-grid system. Buildings are grouped into **city blocks** with roads defining the grid.

### Hierarchy
```
SLOT       — Space for 1 building (24×24 units)
BLOCK      — 2×2 slots = 4 buildings per block (48×48 units)
STREET     — 2-way road between blocks (12 units wide)
BOULEVARD  — 4-lane road every 4 blocks (26 units wide)
SUPERBLOCK — 4×4 blocks bounded by boulevards (254×254 units)
```

### Total City Footprint
- **503 companies** ÷ 4 per block = **126 blocks**
- Grid: **12 columns × 11 rows** = 132 block slots (6 empty)
- City size: **3 superblocks × 3 superblocks** = ~762×762 world units

### Building Dimensions (from market cap)
```ts
height = max(8, log(mcap) / log(maxMcap) × 185)  // Apple ≈185, smallest ≈20
base   = min(20, max(5, √(mcap / maxMcap) × 22 + 4))  // Clamped to fit slot
```

**Design choice:** Volume is intentionally not linear to market cap — cinematic over mathematical purity.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation — all help is appreciated.

### Development Guidelines

1. **Architecture rules:**
   - R3F declarative JSX only in `src/city/` — never `new THREE.Mesh()` inside React components
   - DOM UI only in `src/components/` — never Three.js imports there
   - `src/city/` and `src/components/` communicate **only** through Zustand store
   - `'use client'` required on any file using R3F hooks, `useFrame`, Zustand, or browser APIs

2. **Performance:**
   - `useFrame` for all animation — never `requestAnimationFrame` manually
   - `useMemo` for all canvas textures — never create inside `useFrame` or render
   - No `setState` / Zustand writes inside `useFrame` — causes render loops
   - `InstancedMesh` required when N > 100 buildings

3. **TypeScript:**
   - No `any` — all financial math functions fully typed
   - Sector lookups null-safe: `SECTOR_COLORS[sector] ?? '#8899aa'`

4. **API & Security:**
   - API keys server-side only — route handlers exclusively
   - Always proxy through internal `/api/` routes — never call Finnhub from browser
   - Fallback chain must always work: server cache → localStorage → `FALLBACK_COMPANIES`

### Contributor Quick-Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spy-city
cd spy-city && npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # Add Finnhub key (optional)
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

**Orient yourself:**
- Read [`dimensions.ts`](src/city/dimensions.ts) for building math
- Read [`cityStore.ts`](src/store/cityStore.ts) for all state
- Read [`useCompanyData.ts`](src/hooks/useCompanyData.ts) for data pipeline

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed workflow and expectations.
